This project aims to be a very flexible git repo server, and should require no
specific infrastructure. All authentication and authorization is delegated to
Apache Shiro, which itself is very flexible.

Before building this project, you currently have to build Shiro from source
yourself. See http://incubator.apache.org/shiro/download.html

TODO and GOTCHAS:

If a user pushes to a git repo path which does not already have a git repo in
it, a git repo is automatically created there (given permissions check out).
That is likely not the desired behavior for all installations.

The Main class example is mildly useful on its own. A proper server config and
deployment mechanism is needed.

USING

If you want to try the server, build and boot it up. Then:

mkdir repo
cd repo
git init
touch README
git add README
git commit -m 'first commit'
git remote add origin ssh://USERNAME@localhost:2222/repo.git
git push origin master
